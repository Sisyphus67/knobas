The way that machines learn is concerning to me, and it should concern you as well.  Why?  well, because we are teaching machines to guess, instead of teaching them to think.  The guesses might sometimes work faster than decisions based on heuristics, but we never know why they made that decision.

Now, the sad thing is that most people do not mind this type of behavior because they do not understand their own decisions, but most people don't make a whol lot of decisions and so if they suck at it, it is not going to change the world.

Teaching an AI to suck at self awareness, though, leads to every SciFi ending that resulted from the poor programming of an armed AI.
